# sorting-algorithms-visualization-tool
The project started off out of my interest in algorithm analysis and design and I personally enjoy building tools which enable me or anybody else to understand the concepts clearly.

**Libraries used**: Pygame and Tkinter
The project consists of 4 algorithms.
1) Bubble Sort
2) Insertion Sort
3) Selection Sort 
4) Quick Sort


**To see how the project works**
1) Run the file using Python.
2) A window will pop up wherein a random array represented in the form of vertical bars along with several options will appear.
3) On clicking on **New Array**, a completely new array of random integers gets generated and will be displayed on the screen.
4) On clicking any of the other options, we can see the visualization of how the algorithms work !!!
